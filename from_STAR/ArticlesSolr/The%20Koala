<field name="Introduction">The Koala is a satirical comedy college paper distributed primarily on the campus of the University of California, San Diego, San Diego State University and Cal State San Marcos. The publication at UCSD is one of a handful of campus newspapers partly or entirely funded by the Associated Students of UCSD, the school's student government whose responsibilities include distributing monies to various student organizations. It was founded in 1982, but the details of its origins are uncertain. The composition of the paper consists of artwork, articles, personals, and lists similar to David Letterman's Top Ten List. The Koala's standing protocol when giving interviews to commercial media of any sort is that no statement can be given until they are furnished with beer from the interviewing entity. Exceptions are made for student media as a matter of courtesy.
Nearly all of The Koala's writing involves making fun of a race, ethnicity, religion, group, people with disabilities, sex, or sexual orientation, as well as recent national tragedies. No subject is taboo and boundaries are nonexistent. The paper also encourages a hedonistic lifestyle including alcohol, drugs, and debauchery.
In addition to the print version, The Koala also broadcasts a television show, Koala-TV, as well as having an online portal for readers and staff. The material on both is consistent with the type of humor found in the paper. In addition to The Koala at UCSD, there are also spin-offs of The Koala distributed at San Diego State University and California State University San Marcos (CSUSM).[1]
The official "purpose" of The Koala is "To crush all your hopes and dreams with comedy."
