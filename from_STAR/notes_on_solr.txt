These are just notes on what I am learning in Solr.
First, it seems the solr.home that is being referred
to in the documentation is simply Solr/server/solr
Within that you need a folder that contains your core
core.properties file with the name that you want.
Then, you need a conf folder in that same directory
with a solrconfig.xml file (you can of course change the)
name, but doing so requires that you specify that in
core.properties. And similar stuff for the other files
that go in config (at least I would guess that). Then,
on starting solr, it will find your core and build it!

Also the instance directory is going to be the directory
in which the core.properties is placed

So I have made a new schema file that Solr will actually
accept. You have to declare with the xml at the beginning
then have the schema tag with name and version and then
you add fieldsTypes and then your fields (with the appropriate)
names and type. Finally, for update log to work you need to
include the _version_ field in order for update logs to work.
I have it default to one as it won't actually be specified
in the documents created by simple scraper. Anyways, my schema
contains Title (key), InfoBox, and Introduction fields!

Also, the schema file goes in the config for the core and should
be named schema.xml (unless you specify another name in core.properties)

To delete all use the command <delete><query>*:*</query></delete>

To index from a file:
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/core1/update -H "Content-Type: text/xml"
  --data-binary @filename

To query a file you need the prefix:
https://http://localhost:8983/solr/core1/select?
and then you add in q= and then for example *:* to query everything.
the first value before the colon is going to be a field name and then
the second value is going to be a value that you are searching for

To limit the fields you use fl= and then the fields you wish to limit.

Finally to turn on faceting you use facet=true
facet.field turns on the faceting of certain fields
facet.contains limits what can show up in the results (i.e. what is queried
over)

facet takes as its default query finding the various terms and then counting
the number of instances of each.

ALSO! If I add a word to the stopwords file in core1/conf then
Solr just ignores that word! (Of course you have to reindex to allow
changes to take effect, but very cool!)
