Okay so we have a schema and we that schema to build itself into an
HTML page. The way we can do this is to essentially mark the place
where specific fields are going to be input. I think I will do this
in the following way:

  Given a schema file we include a meta-info tag that determines a name
  that will be used in queries and the like (it is essentially an
  identifier of the table to be queried where the field names are encompassed
  in the schema that defines that table(s))

  Then we shall mark a where a field value must be put with |{field_name}
  Then we shall have an application which replaces these field names with
  some values that will have been grabbed based off of other information
  that has come through some client connection. (note we need to make sure
  the pipe can be escaped with a \)

  So I am of course going to use the wiki stuff for a start :)

  Note that we may want to preprocess the data after it comes through
  a query to add some html or the like to it.

  ***Okay next step is to use the field extractor to get the fields from a document
  and then apply a processor to each field, and then CREATE AN OBJECT THAT CAN
  HANDLE KNOWING WHERE THE FIELDS ARE IN THE DOCUMENT AND QUICKLY DO INSERTS.
  SO A DICTIONARY OF KEYS AND VALUES IS GIVEN AND SIMPLE METHODS ARE CALLED TO
  RUN A LOOP TO ADD THE FIELDS: have the object record field names and positions
  and lengths in a dictionary. Then use this information to create a list that
  then allows you to run backwards, using the process information to fill things
  in.
