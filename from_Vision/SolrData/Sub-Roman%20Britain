<field name="title">Sub-Roman Britain</field>
<field name="InfoBox"></field>
<field name="Introduction">Sub-Roman Britain is a term derived from an archaeological label for the material culture of Great Britain in Late Antiquity. The term "Sub-Roman" was invented to describe the potsherds in sites of the 5th and 6th century, initially with an implication of decay of locally-made wares from a higher standard under the Roman Empire.
It is now often used to denote a period of history; the term "post-Roman Britain" is also used for the period, mainly in non-archaeological contexts. Although the culture of Britain in the period was mainly derived from Roman and Celtic sources, there were also Saxons settled as foederati in the area, originally from Saxony in northwestern Germany, although the term 'Saxon' was used by the British for all Germanic incomers. Gradually the latter assumed more control (see Anglo-Saxon England). The Picts in northern Scotland were outside the applicable area.
