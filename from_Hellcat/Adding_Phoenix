Question: Now that I have a pseudo-cluster, how do I put phoenix on top?

So you download the phoenix binary from online and unpackage it.
Then you do the whole renaming thing if you like.
Then take the phoenix-<version>-server.jar and put it in the hbase
lib directory. Then restart HBase and go to /bin in the phoenix directory
and enter the SQL command line with ./sqlline.py <zookeeper client address
from HBase configuration>

# Note that if you just run ./sqlline.py it will assume zookeeper is on
# localhost:2181, mine for example was on localhost:2081, so I had to specify
# the client port.

Anyways... this is fucking cool! :D
