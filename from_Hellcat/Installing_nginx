QUESTION: Basic nginx install?

Download the source of the latest stable version.
Extract it and move inside that directory.
Do the following:
./configure
make
make install

It will install it in the directory /usr/local/nginx

To start it, just go ahead and go into the /usr/local/nginx/sbin
and run nginx

To add pages, the default root is the html directory is usr/local/nginx

To stop (using the same directory as above):
./nginx -s stop
(same idea for reload and all of that)
