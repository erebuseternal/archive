Question: How do I start Solr Cloud?

Okay, so here goes:
you need to have a home directory for each instance you want
to start up. Inside at a minimum must be solr.xml (I'm using the
one from the cloud examples... so we shall have to figure out
what's going on in them) Then for each instance call:

bin/solr start -p <port #> -s <location for this node's solr home> -z <list of zookeeper addresses>

After this you are at least going to have to start calling
bin/solr create -c mycollection -d config_name

This will, in theory, create the shards folders with the data directory
and a core properties with what you want.

Next questions:
What does solr.xml do exactly?
What is a solrconfig? How does it work?
What is available in the collection creation api

After these things have been answered we can go ahead and index some shit!
And then search it!

So far I'm really loving solr though
